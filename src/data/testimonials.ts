    quote: 'I\'ve had the pleasure of joining an engineering team led by Prasath at the time. From day one, he welcomed me in the best possible wayâ€”guiding me through the codebase, features, and, most importantly, the people! Prasath played a key role in orchestrating our efforts in a fast-moving, agile startup. He pushed features quickly and helped bridge cultural differences and gaps, seamlessly connecting teams from Cairo to Tel Aviv via Chennai! Anyone who has the opportunity to work with Prasath will benefit greatly, and I truly hope to join forces with him again in the future!',
